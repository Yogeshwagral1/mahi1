# Steps to connect to the Database from Java Application:

1. Load and register the Drivers with DriverManager.
    - Load the driver class [A class that implments the java.sql.Driver(I)] in the memory
    - Once Driver class is loaded in the memory, static block of that class will be executed
    - static block
        static {
            DriverManager.registerDriver(new Driver());
        }
    - After java 7, loading & registering the drivers with DriverManager happens automatically.
        - If the jar file is added to the classpath[project] then it will be loaded.
    - Before Java 7, we have to explicitly load the class in the memory
        - Class.forName("complete class name with package");

2. Get Connection from DriverManager
    - Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
        - Connection(I) provided by java.sql
        - Object of type Connection : DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password) provides the object of type Connection which is provided by vendor

3. Execute the queries and store the result
        - To execute the query we have to create object of type Statement[]
        - Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
            - Statement(I) provided by java.sql
            - connection.createStatement();-- object of type Statement provided by vendor

        - ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * from student");
            - ResultSet(I) present in java.sql
            - statement.executeQuery()- object of type ResultSet provided by vendor

4. Use the Result
    - resultSet.next(): --> returns true or false.
    - get columns : resultSet.getXXX(1);
    - get columns : resultSet.getXXX("columnName");
5. Close the connection
    - connection.close();


 # Different types of SQL queries
 - SELECT : executeQuery();
 - DML[INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE] : executeUpdate();
    - to execute multiple DML commands : executeBatch()
 - DDL [CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE] : execute();

* executeQuery(), executeUpdate(), executeBatch(), execute() are methods present in Statement(I)
    and these methods are implemented by vendor
